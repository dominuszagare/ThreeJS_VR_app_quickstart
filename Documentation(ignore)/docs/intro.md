# Intro

This qide will provide a breif overview on how to implement a VR aplication inside a browser window. For this we are going to use the ThreeJS grafics libary to create simple scene. Covering basic concepts like meshes, materials, lights, cameras, vectors... that enable us to create 3D enviroments.

# Alternatives

For complete beginers this aproach may not be optimal. This project contains a lot of code that may be intimidating for beginers. A simpler aproach would be using [A-frame](https://aframe.io/) framework where we use a more abstract system of describing the virtual enviromet, with a lot of logic built in. This aproach results in way less code but is less flexable.

# Recomendations

If you are not already using git for version control I recomend you to start using it. It is a very usefull tool for keeping track of changes in your code and for collaboration with other developers. Feel free to use any git client you like. If you are using VSCode you can use the built in git client. For bether experiance I recomend using GitLens extension.
