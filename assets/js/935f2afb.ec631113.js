For this, we are going to use the ThreeJS graphics library to create a simple scene. Covering basic concepts like meshes, materials, lights, cameras, vectors... that enable us to create 3D environments.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial_1/create_scene":{"id":"tutorial_1/create_scene","title":"Create 3D environment","description":"First how do we render a 3D object inside our browser. The answers is WebGl but using raw WebGL is a very convoluted and time consuming process. So we use a library called ThreeJS that does all the hard work for us when it comes to managing the rendering pipeline. For more on WebGL and computer graphics in general checkout webgl2fundamentals.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorial_1/importing_glft_models":{"id":"tutorial_1/importing_glft_models","title":"importing GLFT models","description":"In the previous tutorial we learned how to setup a basic three.js project and how to create a scene with a single cube. Now we will be adding a model to the scene. We will be using the gltf format for the model. The gltf format is a binary format for 3D models that is supported by most 3D software. The model we will be using is 3D scan of a operating room. The model can be downloaded from here. We will also be importing a custom model made in Blender.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"using_modules":{"id":"using_modules","title":"using modules","description":"In the previous tutorial we learned how to setup a basic three.js project but from now on we will be adding more and more code to the project. This will make it harder to keep track of everything and it will also make it harder to reuse code in other projects. To solve this problem we will be using modules to organize our code.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
